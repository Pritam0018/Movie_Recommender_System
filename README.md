# Movie Recommender System

 ## Problem Statement:
 Build a movie recommendation system which gives you suggestion of similar movies by doing clustering and calculating similarity scores. The purpose is to improve user satisfaction by suggesting 
 a movie with which the user has higher likelihood of interest, thus addressing the challenges of information overload and user disengagement in movie selection.

### Approach: ###

1. Data Collection
2. 
3. Data Preprocessing

4. Feature Extraction

5. Cosine Similarity Calculation:

->Implemented cosine similarity to assess the proximity between movie vectors.

->Developed an algorithm to recommend the top 5 nearest movies for each user based on selected preferences.

5. K-means Clustering: Applied K-means clustering to group movies based on similarity.
 
6. API Integration:

Integrated IMDB API to dynamically fetch movie posters and metadata based on user-selected movie titles, enhancing the user interface and overall experience of the movie recommender system.
